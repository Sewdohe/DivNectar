# CraftNectar

I finally made a Minecraft server! 

I've been wating to do this for years and years! It feels so good to have finally done it.

## How to Connect

**The server is compatible with the following clients:**
  * Create: Optimized [Fabric] v0.5g

### Windows & MacOS
1. Use the Curseforge app or FTB (fead the beast) app to download the client needed (create: Optimized v0.5g)
2. Extract the [Client Modpack](https://nextcloud.divnectar.com/s/amdeTzxFjJKAZkc/download/craftnectar-clientpack.zip) file into the instance you just created's mods folder
3. Launch instance, connect to `craft.divnectar.com`

### Linux
On Linux, setup is a bit more involved. Here is a short rundown on how I got it working:

1. Install prism launcher
2. Click create instance
3. Select the CurseForge tab
4. Search for Create
5. Select Create: Optimized [Fabric] v0.5g
6. Once the instance is created, extract the [Client Modpack](https://nextcloud.divnectar.com/s/amdeTzxFjJKAZkc/download/craftnectar-clientpack.zip) into the instance mods folder
7. Launch client and connect to `craft.divnectar.com` 




## Some Important Notes
- When you first connect, I'd reccomend checking out the keybinds in the pause menu. This will give you a very good idea of what you can do
on the server
- You can't break blocks in a 7x7 area around spawn.
- M key brings up the minimap.
- This is a techinical building SMP - we have 4 tech mods on the server:
  - Create (rotationally powered machines)
  - Create: Crafts & Additions (bridges rotational energy and regular energy)
  - Tech Reborn (Proccessing tools and QOL improvements via machines)
  - Applied Energestics 2 (digital item storage system)
