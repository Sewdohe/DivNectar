# CraftNectar

I finally made a Minecraft server! 

I've been wating to do this for years and years! It feels so good to have finally done it.

## Connection

The server is compatible with the following clients:

You can get reccomended client-side mods from here:  [here](https://nextcloud.divnectar.com/s/jFx8pD5jeXN4ndR "Nextcloud Files for Craftnectar")

You won't need to download any of the server-side mods.
