# CraftNectar

I finally made a Minecraft server! 

I've been wating to do this for years and years! It feels so good to have finally done it.

## Connection

The server is compatible with the following clients:
  * Better Minecraft [Forge] 1.19.2

Use the Curseforge app to download the client needed to connect to the server

You can get the modpack from here:  [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-modpack "Better Minecraft")

You won't need to download any of the server-side mods.
